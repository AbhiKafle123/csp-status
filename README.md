# csp-status
looking into csp adoption and directives

tl;dr: Looking into how many websites have actually implemented CSP.

1) 90% of implementation are bypassable anyway.[1] 

2) In Alexa top 1000, about 95(i.e. >1%) have CSP implemented. 
(If you look at alexa top 10,000, the number goes down to about 450 (>0.5%) have implemented CSP in some way.)

So, actual beneficiaries of CSP - 10% of the 95 sites in alexa top 1000. Thats a handful of sites.

Just looking at implementation, makes me think, was making CSP a standard wise idea?
